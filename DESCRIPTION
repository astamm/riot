Description: An input-output interface for reading in and writing out common 
    VTK formats that store tractography data. This data comes in the form of 3D 
    polygons with possibly attributes at each point. These are obtained via 
    tracking algorithms from diffusion MRI and are a non-invasive way of 
    studying brain structural connectivity.
