## Overview

The [**riot**](https://astamm.github.io/riot/) (R Input/Output for
Tractography) package provides an R interface for importing and exporting
tractography data to and from `R`. Currently supported importing formats are:

- native [VTK](https://vtk.org) `.vtk` and `.vtp` files; 
- [medInria](https://med.inria.fr) `.fds' files; 
- [MRtrix](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/image_data.html)
`.tck/.tsf` files; and, 
- [TrackVis](http://trackvis.org/docs/?subsect=fileformat) `.trk` files.

The package reads tractography data into a
[tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org) in which each row is a point
characterized by at least the following five variables:

- `X`, `Y`, `Z`: 3D coordinates of the current point; 
- `PointId`: Identification number of the current point among all points of the
streamline it belongs to;
- `StreamlineId`: Identification number of the streamline which the current
point belongs to.

The points might also have attributes or a color assigned to them, in which
case, additional variables will be properly created to import them as well. The
user can perform statistical analysis on the point cloud and store any new
variable that (s)he would deem to be useful as additional column of the
[tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org). The package also allows to write back
the [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org), including all newly created
attributes, into the following exporting formats:

- native [VTK](https://vtk.org) `.vtk` and `.vtp` files; or,
- [medInria](https://med.inria.fr) `.fds` files.

## Installation

You can install the released version of
[**riot**](https://astamm.github.io/riot/) from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) with:

```r
install.packages("riot")
```

Alternatively you can install the development version of
[**riot**](https://astamm.github.io/riot/) from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("astamm/riot")
```

## Example

```{r riot-import}
library(riot)
```

### Native [VTK](https://vtk.org) `.vtk` and `.vtp` files

```{r vtk}
uf_left_vtk  <- read_fascicles(system.file("extdata", "UF_left.vtk",  package = "riot"))
uf_left_vtk
```

```{r vtp}
uf_left_vtp  <- read_fascicles(system.file("extdata", "UF_left.vtp",  package = "riot"))
uf_left_vtp
```

### [medInria](https://med.inria.fr) `.fds' files

```{r fds}
uf_left_fds  <- read_fascicles(system.file("extdata", "UF_left.fds",  package = "riot"))
uf_left_fds
```

### [MRtrix](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/image_data.html) `.tck/.tsf` files

```{r tck}
af_left_tck  <- read_fascicles(system.file("extdata", "AF_left.tck",  package = "riot"))
af_left_tck
```

### [TrackVis](http://trackvis.org/docs/?subsect=fileformat) `.trk` files

```{r trk}
cc_mid_trk  <- read_fascicles(system.file("extdata", "CCMid.trk",  package = "riot"))
cc_mid_trk
```

## Dependencies

The [**riot**](https://astamm.github.io/riot/) package has two dependencies:
[VTK](https://vtk.org/) and
[TinyXML-2](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2). They both have been
slightly altered with respect to the original softwares for compliance with
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) policy. Specifically, `vtk/include/utf8.h`
header file has been modified to ensure LF line endings. Also, `tinyxml2.cpp`
has been modified to avoid the use of `stdout` and `printf` as per *Writing R
Extensions* manual recommendations because `R` has its own input/output
mechanism for writing to the console.

The authors would like to thank Tim SchÃ¤fer, the author of the
[**freesurferformats**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/freesurferformats/index.html)
package, for his helpful code to read
[MRtrix](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/image_data.html)
and [TrackVis](http://trackvis.org/docs/?subsect=fileformat) tractography file
formats.
